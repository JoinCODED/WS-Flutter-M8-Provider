# Notes APP

In this example, we will create a note app. First, we will create this app by using the regular way that we learned before which is the **setState** way, and later we will learn how to use the **provider** state management.

We will learn how to use:

- **insert** list method
- **SingleChildScrollView** widget
- **Provider** state management.
- **FloatingActionButton** widget

1. Download the starter project from GitHub, then open the project by using the VS Code, and get the packages.

> https://github.com/JoinCODED/flutter_notes_app_starter

2. Inside the project, we will have three folders,
   1. **models**, inside this folder we created a **Note** model, and it has three values; **id** value, **title** value & **body** value.
   2. **widgets**, inside this folder, we created a note list tile, and we will use it later to display the note details.
3. Inside the **Pages** folder, you will find two pages that you will use in the note app.
   1. **home_page.dart**, here you will find the user interface for the home screen.
   2. **note_page.dart**, here we will display the note details.
