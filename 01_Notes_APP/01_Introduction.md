# Notes APP

In this module, we will create a note app by using the regular way that we learned before, which is the **setState** method. Later on, we will learn about the **provider** state management, and how to use the following tools:

- **insert** list method
- **SingleChildScrollView** widget
- **Provider** state management.
- **FloatingActionButton** widget

1. Fork and clone the starter point of the project from [GitHub](https://github.com/Northwest-content/flutter_notes_app_starter), open it in the VS Code, and get the packages.

> Inside the project, there three folders:
> a. The **models** folder, which contains a **Note** model that has three values: **id**, **title**, and **body** value.
> b. The **widgets** folder, which contains a note list tile, which will be used to display the note details.
> c. The **Pages** folder, which contains two pages:

> - The **home_page.dart** file, which displays the user interface of the home screen.
> - The **note_page.dart** file, which will display the note details.
